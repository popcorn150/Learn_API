--> Pratice Test [Profile Lookup]

Hint 1
    - Use a for loop to cycle through the contacts list.

Hint 2
    - Use a nested if statement to first check if the firstName matches, and then checks if the prop matches.

Hint 3
    - Leave your return "No such contact" out of the for loop as a final catch-all.

Hint 4
    - A function immediately stops at the point where return is called.

--> Code Explanation
    - The for loop runs, starting at the first object in the contacts list.
    - If the firstName parameter passed into the function matches the value of the "firstName" key in the first object, the if statement passes.
    - Then, we use .hasOwnProperty() method (checks if there’s a given property and returns a boolean) with prop as an argument. If it’s true, the value of prop is returned.
    - If the second if statement fails, No such property is returned.
    - If the first if statement fails, the for loop continues on to the next object in the contacts list.
    - If the firstName parameter isn’t matched by the final contacts object, the for loop exits and No such contact is returned.
